  "background": [ "Here's a little more about me. I have always been intersted in technology, and especially the internet, but I didn't really begin coding, or exploring web development as a career possibility until I started graduate school at Washington University in St. Louis. In my first year, I joined a reading group focused on digital approaches to the humanities. We would meet and talk about current \"Digital Humanities\" research that we found intersting and we'd teach eachother how to use a variety of tools that could enhance our humanities research. That's where I started to dabble in Python programming, which led me down the web development rabbit hole.", "Fast forward to today, and I've had the privilege of working on a number of projects for professors, and the Film and Media archive, building and repairing website functionality. In 2022, I was accepted into an 8 month long web development bootcamp offered by LaunchCode. It's here where I've really started to hone my skills, and dive head first into web development. I consider myself a lifelong learner, on a constant pursuit to expand my skillset expanding my skillset to keep up with the ever-evolving world of software and web development. I am a problem-solver at heart and thrive on the challege of finding creative solutions to complex problems." ],
